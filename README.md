# E-Commerce-Store

## Description

My motivation was to create a back-end for an e-commerce site. I built this project because of how prevalent internet retail has become across the globe. This problem solves diorganization when it comes to inventory. I learned how to configure a Express.js API to use Sequelize in order for it to interact with a MySQL database.
